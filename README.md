Inspired by the diverse styles, materials, periods that make up the architecture of London I set out to make an app that replicates the cheek by jowl nature of the architectural lexicon of the city. Aimed at architecture and urban enthusiasts, Dwell is a place to host, accumulate and share information on a stylish, user friendly platform. 

Powered by a postgreSQL database built with Ruby on Rails shaped with Active Record.  A single page application, the front end is handled by AngularJS and for layout and styling Bootstrap. Dwell is safe as houses, fully authenticated using bCrypt and JWT.

For me the success of the project was in the planning and learning from past experience of other short term projects. I sketched out the app in detail prior to starting. This led to smooth workflow with relatively few hiccups.
